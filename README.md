# Guarden_Guard

A motion activated sentry designed to drop something noisy to deter birds and squirrels from getting into the garden and eating tomatoes.  Has a built in solar battery charger, PIR motion sensor input, NCH circuit for powering a solenoid, and outputs to an H-Bridge to get a motor to drop a noisy thing and then spool it back up (where the solenoid locks it in place).

Still a WIP since I never got around to building the hoisting mechanism.  Also in the end I just planted extra stuff outside the fence for animals so as to not be a tomato miser.  But it was a fun board to make.
