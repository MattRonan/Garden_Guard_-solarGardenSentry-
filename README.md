A motion activated sentry designed to drop something noisy to deter birds and squirrels from getting into the garden and eating tomatoes.  Has an input for a solar panel to power its battery charger, PIR motion sensor input, photo transistor input, NCH circuit for powering a solenoid, and outputs to an H-Bridge to get a motor to drop a noisy thing and then spool it back up (where the solenoid locks it in place).  CPU is an ATTINY to be as small and low power as possible.

basic hoisting setup:

Still a WIP since I never got around to physically building the hoisting mechanism, and probably moreso because I realized I could just buy some netting and spare alot of small animals a heart attack.  Currently the board is instead enjoying its life as a a solar powered LED strip driver.
