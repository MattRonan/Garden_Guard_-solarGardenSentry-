A motion activated sentry designed to drop something noisy to deter birds and squirrels from getting into the garden and eating tomatoes.  Has a built in solar battery charger, PIR motion sensor input, photo transistor input, NCH circuit for powering a solenoid, and outputs to an H-Bridge to get a motor to drop a noisy thing and then spool it back up (where the solenoid locks it in place).  CPU is an ATTINY to be as small and low power as possible.

Sketch of basic hoisting setup:

Still a WIP since I never got around to building the hoisting mechanism.  Also in the end I just planted extra stuff outside the fence for animals so as to not be a tomato miser.  But it was a fun board to make.
